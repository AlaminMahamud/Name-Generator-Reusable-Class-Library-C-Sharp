# Class Library 

## Definition
in object oriented programming a class library is a collection of prewritten class es or coded templates, any of which can be specified and used by a programmer when developing an application program. The programmer specifies which classes are being used and furnishes data that instantiate s each class as an object. That can be called when an program is executed. Access to and use of a class Library greatly simplifies the job of the programmer since standard, pretested code is available that the programmer doesn't have to write.

## History
A Class Library is Analogous to Subrouting Library in earlier, procedural programming

## Reusable Class Library
Creat separate dll that contains shared Logic for Applications
In that way we have a centralized assembly that contains the code.
In .NET compiling a class library generates a .dll file
